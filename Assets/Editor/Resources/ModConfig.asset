  description: '[b]WORK IN PROGRESS[/b]


    In this gameplay room, work on a production line with a conveyor belt bringing
    you bomb after bomb to defuse before they get shipped out!


    This gameplay room is designed mainly with Multiple Bombs in mind, and currently
    can support up-to 32 bombs.


    As this is a work in progress, expect things to change drastically from version
    to version. At the moment, the design is not particularly finalised, but at the
    very least the gameplay mechanic is in place!


    As of v0.4.2, a new component pool ID discovery process has been added, meaning
    all previously-defined missions will work in static mode only. To support the
    finite sequential mode for missions, add a component pool with the ID "Factory
    Mode" and with a ''count'' of 1 (1 indicates finite sequential mode). More modes
    will be added in the future, and will likely use this field further with different
    ''count'' indexes.


    As of v0.4.3, a new cross-mod API has been added, but there''s only one property
    to query at the moment:

    - [i]"SupportedModes" -> string[][/i]: An array of friendly names for the currently
    supported factory modes; the index of each name corresponds to the "Factory Mode"
    component ''count'' for that given gameplay mode.'
  version: v0.4.3
