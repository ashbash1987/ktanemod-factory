  description: '[b]WORK IN PROGRESS[/b]


    In this gameplay room, work on a production line with a conveyor belt bringing
    you bomb after bomb to defuse before they get shipped out!


    This gameplay room is designed mainly with Multiple Bombs in mind, and currently
    can support up-to 32 bombs.


    As this is a work in progress, expect things to change drastically from version
    to version. At the moment, the design is not particularly finalised, but at the
    very least the gameplay mechanic is in place!'
