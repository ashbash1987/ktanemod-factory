# Factory - a KTaNEModKit Mod

This mod provides a gameplay room resembling a factory-style production line for the defusing of bombs in a sequential manner, differing from the current style of multiple bombs gameplay whereby all bombs would start and should be defused simultaneously.

## Working with the Factory

For all details on how to get the Factory building, to how to configure custom missions to work with the Factory, head on over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-factory/wiki) for more information.

## I have ideas!

Cool! If you've got an idea for how the factory room should be styled/themed, and/or any cool ideas for easter eggs in the room (I do love adding easter eggs to things!), then head on to the [issues page](https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-factory/issues) and create an issue there with your idea.

## I have bugs!

Not so cool, but anticipated! Please post them to the [issues page](https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-factory/issues), including any steps to reproduce, platform you're playing on, and any log files if necessary.

## I have pull requests for things!

I might accept pull requests for small bug fixes, but for major functionality, I'd at least like to know about it first before you just submit pull requests. Don't go wasting your time on something that I might already be working on!
